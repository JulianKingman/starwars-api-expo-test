Hello there candidate!

For this stage you will be tasked with developing a really awesome React Native app that interacts with the Star Wars API (SWAPI - https://swapi.py4e.com/api) to fetch and display data about characters from the Star Wars universe, while adhering to coding readability, testability, maintainability and best practices! Feel free to incorporate third-party libraries or tools deemed appropriate for the task. Good luck and may the force be with you!

As a prerequisite, please prepare a bare-bones React Native project that is up and running before the interview so there is no delay getting started.

Instructions

Fetch Data from SWAPI: Develop an API layer to fetch data from the SWAPI endpoint (https://swapi.py4e.com/api/people/).
Display Fetched Data: Create a basic UI to display the fetched data in a list, initially rendering top-level metadata for characters.
Implement Basic Error and Loading Handling: Ensure robust data handling, which includes loading and error states in both the API layer and the UI layer.
Write Unit Tests: Write comprehensive unit tests.
Add Pagination Mechanism: Implement a pagination mechanism to seamlessly fetch more people from the SWAPI endpoint, while maintaining an intuitive user experience.

# TODO's
[ ] Figure out why the data is sometimes undefined
[ ] Add Maestro tests
  [ ] Add MSW to mock the API
[ ] Smooth out error handling
